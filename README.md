## Takabbur
1. Never have takabbur on yourself.

In battle of Hunain Shaba thought, who will defeat us as we are 10,000 in numbers but muslims was set in a trap, & Allah(S.W.T) saved them. So trust in Allah(S.W.T) noy yourself.
Because in battle of badr only 300+ sahaba defeated 1000+ people army, not with there power but with there trust in Allah(S.W.T) & there Emaan.

`Everything comes from Allah no matter how big we are or how small we are.`

2. If you win Never have takkabur as our prophet(S.A.W) when he conquered meccah, he lowered his head & touched camel's neck & entered meccah. 


## Running for duniya
Don't run for this duniya.

In battle of Uhud some sahaba left there places(Prophet(S.A.W) had told them not to change there places from uhad moutain what so ever happen) for Maal E Ghanimah & face a big masacarh, almost of them were killed and situation of war had changed and gone from the hands of muslims.


## Going back & forth for good deeds
When you hesitate or go back and forth to do good deeds  or sacrifice in the name of Allah(S.W.T).

`**Remember Abdullah ib Rawaha**` In battle of mutah Abdullah ibn Rawaha's mind going back and forth to go towards enemy's squad he told himself what are you? A drop of water. what you wanted(Shahadat) is infront of you, if you won't go I will force you to go, and he became shaeed in battle of mutah along with Zaid ib haritah & Jaffar ibn Abu talib(R.A).

## Forgiving Others 
If you forgive others, Allah will forgive you.

`As Our prophet(S.A.W) forgave his uncle Hamza's murderers, people of ta'aif, people of mecca etc.`


## Using hard or inappropiate words
In some situations if it comes on pur prophet(S.A.W) or Allah(S.W.T) or Islam its ok to use hards words or inappropiate words.

`As Abu bakr(R.A) said to the leader of ta'aif when he said something bad about sahaba and there Emaan.`


## Mashwarah

1. If you are a leader always do mashwarah with you companians `As our prophet(S.A.W) did it before every battle`.
2. If you wanna do something always do mashwarah with your family, friends, & elders. `As our prophet(S.A.W) did before marrying Umar(R.A) daughter.`


## Presenting yourself

Be generous and present yourself as best human, remember! by your manners & dealings you are representing Islam.

`As after the treaty of hudaibiyah, when muslims and non-muslims were opened to trade. It was the time of largest conversions of paigans in Arabian peninsula as they were impressed with the honesty and manners of sahaba.`

## Fullfiling Promise

Always fullfil your promise.

`As our prophet(S.A.W) gave Abu Jandal(R.A) to his father when he escaped from him, because of treaty of hudaibiyah. Prophet(S.A.W) gave a muslim to a paigan because of promise that were made during traety of hudaibiyah that if any of people of meccah escapes and comes to madinah they should be returned to there relatives.`

So Always fullfil your promise and Allah will always be with you InshaAllah.

And when Prophet(S.A.W) returned Abu Jandal(R.A) then he again escaped and other sahabas who escaped from quresh and can't go to madinah they form a group outside madinah and attacked caravans of quresh, the Abu sufiyan requested prophet(S.A.W) to take the into madinah, so this is how Allah(S.A.W) helped.


## Being Gossipmonger

Don't be gossipmonger because it is not befitting for a muslim to gossip.

Remember the story of Ayesha(R.A)'s slander, how gossip can make the slanders and falso so big.


## Being hasty to judge

Always confirm and ask people when you hear they said something about you.

On the day of the Conquest of Mecca, when the Prophet (ﷺ) had given (from the booty) the Quraish, the Ansar said, "By Allah, this is indeed very strange: While our swords are still dribbling with the blood of Quraish, our war booty are distributed amongst them.`" When this news reached the Prophet (ﷺ) he called the Ansar and said, "What is this news that has reached me from you?"` They used not to tell lies, so they replied, "What has reached you is true." He said, "Doesn't it please you that the people take the booty to their homes and you take Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to your homes? If the Ansar took their way through a valley or a mountain pass, I would take the Ansar's valley or a mountain pass."

So this teaches us to always confirm the news you hears.

*And when you have something in your heart about your brother speak out, talk to them & don't keep it in your heart. else shaitan will make the differences bigger.*


## Verdicts on people

Don't pronounce verdits on people, leave there affairs to Allah(S.W.T).

Don't verbalize bad deeds of people and leave there inner dimensions to Allah(S.W.T).

`As it's Allah(S.W.T)'s right to judge people not ours.`

## Overlook criticism.

Overlook people who criticized you.

## Defending your brother's honour

Always defend the honour of your brother, in his absence.

`As Muaz ib Jabal(R.A) saved honour of Ka'ab ibn malik and Allah defend him from fire of hell.`

When the Prophet ﷺ got to Tabuk, he enquired:‘What happened to Ka’ab?’ A man from amongst the tribe of Bani Salimah responded: ‘O Messenger of Allah ﷺ he was hindered by his garments and pleasure for his clothes and his self.’ Then, Mu’adh ibn Jabal said: ‘What a wretched statement you have uttered. O Messenger of Allah ﷺ, we do not know of him save goodness.’ There are two key things to note here: how Mu’adh stood to defend the honor of Ka’b and how Ka’b also concealed the identity of the man who spoke ill of him. Another lesson for us is to always think positively about others.

## Repenting

All human beings makes mistake and do sins but moimins are those who repents and feel guilty about there mistakes and sins.

“O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allāh. Indeed, Allāh forgives all sins. Verily, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.” — Qur’an 39[Az-Zumar]:53

## 2 rakat's after safar

It is sunnah to pray 2 rakats when you return to your city after travelling.

## Righteous Companionship

Always choose righteous companionshp.

And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger will be in the company of those blessed by Allah: the prophets, the people of truth, the martyrs, and the righteous—what honourable company!" (Quran 4:69).
