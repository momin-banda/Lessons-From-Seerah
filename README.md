## Takabbur
1. Never have takabbur on yourself.

In battle of Hunain Shaba thought, who will defeat us as we are 10,000 in numbers but muslims was set in a trap, & Allah(S.W.T) saved them. So trust in Allah(S.W.T) noy yourself.
Because in battle of badr only 300+ sahaba defeated 1000+ people army, not with there power but with there trust in Allah(S.W.T) & there Emaan.

`Everything comes from Allah no matter how big we are or how small we are.`

2. If you win Never have takkabur as our prophet(S.A.W) when he conquered meccah, he lowered his head & touched camel's neck & entered meccah. 


## Running for duniya
Don't run for this duniya.

In battle of Uhud some sahaba left there places(Prophet(S.A.W) had told them not to change there places from uhad moutain what so ever happen) for Maal E Ghanimah & face a big masacarh, almost of them were killed and situation of war had changed and gone from the hands of muslims.


## Going back & forth for good deeds
When you hesitate or go back and forth to do good deeds  or sacrifice in the name of Allah(S.W.T).

`**Remember Abdullah ib Rawaha**` In battle of mutah Abdullah ibn Rawaha's mind going back and forth to go towards enemy's squad he told himself what are you? A drop of water. what you wanted(Shahadat) is infront of you, if you won't go I will force you to go, and he became shaeed in battle of mutah along with Zaid ib haritah & Jaffar ibn Abu talib(R.A).

## Forgiving Others 
If you forgive others, Allah will forgive you.

`As Our prophet(S.A.W) forgave his uncle Hamza's murderers, people of ta'aif, people of mecca etc.`


## Using hard or inappropiate words
In some situations if it comes on pur prophet(S.A.W) or Allah(S.W.T) or Islam its ok to use hards words or inappropiate words.

`As Abu bakr(R.A) said to the leader of ta'aif when he said something bad about sahaba and there Emaan.`


## Mashwarah

1. If you are a leader always do mashwarah with you companians `As our prophet(S.A.W) did it before every battle`.
2. If you wanna do something always do mashwarah with your family, friends, & elders. `As our prophet(S.A.W) did before marrying Umar(R.A) daughter.`
